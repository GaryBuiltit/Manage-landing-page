## Overview

I created a landing page for a fake software company called Manage. The design was provided by frontendMentor.com and coded by me. Buttons do not lead to any other pages but shows active hover states. It is a responsive design that adjust to different screen sizes and changes testimonials into a slider on mobile devices.
